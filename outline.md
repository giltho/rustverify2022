# An initial outline 

...that will surely get outdated.

## Things I want to convey

* Rust "raising the bar"
* Formality is a useful step forward
* Advertise types team
* Key elements of formality
    * Separating out the layers
        * Logic -- horn clauses, no rust semantics
        * Types -- just types and relations between them
        * Decls -- 
        * MIR 
        * MIR operational semantics
    * Able to reason about each one at the right level
* Examples where I am using it
    * Perfect derive + Implied bounds
        * Source of a number of known soundness bugs in Rust
        * Also a pain for users!
        * We've struggled to concisely specify and model correct behavior
        * In Formality, we are able to talk about this at the 
    * Soundness around contravariance? Associated types?
* Things I am looking forward to tackling
    * Specialization
    * Const generics
* Roadmap
    * First goal -- describe the "Rust we want" -- today's rust, but not broken
    * 
* What would I like to know
    * Would love to talk about the details
